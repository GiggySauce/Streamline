# Streamline
is a Blender addon that simplifies the cleaning and organization of 3D models by allowing easy removal of all vertex groups and modifiers from selected objects. With Streamline, artists can improve their workflow by quickly removing unwanted components from their models, keeping their scene tidy and optimized.

# Features v2.0
- It was updated with Blender 4.2 in mind, I don't know if it works for 4.1 and 4.0.
- Added a button to rename the "Mesh data-block" according to its name in "Object data-block"
- Re-planned the script to be more orderly in case of adding new things.

- Added a completely new section related to the cameras, you can select which camera to leave active and from there control different features of the camera, apart from being able to rename it and be compatible with the button mentioned above.
